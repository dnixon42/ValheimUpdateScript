# Valheim Update Script
Just a real ugly script to make me use python. Put together in Python 3 it requires the libraries it requires, and to make it work you'll need to have set up valheim as a service with an update script. You'll also need to add the sudo call to systemctl into your sudoers.d directory or equiv. This code is a real ugly mess, but if it's stupid and it works it isn't stupid.
